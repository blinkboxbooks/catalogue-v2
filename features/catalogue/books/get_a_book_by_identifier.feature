  Scenario: Books retrieved by identifier are publicly cacheable
    Given there is a book which is currently available for purchase
    When I request that book by identifier
    Then the response is publicly cacheable

  Scenario: Trying to get a book with a nonexistent identifier
    When I request a book by identifier, which does not exist
    Then the request fails because the book was not found

  Scenario: Trying to get a book with a non-alphanumeric identifier
    When I request a book by invalid identifier
    Then the request fails because the book was not found
